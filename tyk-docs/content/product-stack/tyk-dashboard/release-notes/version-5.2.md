## Changelog

### Added

- **TT-8809:** We've introduced open telemetry support for GraphQL proxy and UDG, allowing you to gain end-to-end visibility into requests. This enhancement simplifies troubleshooting and fault diagnosis by providing insights from the very start to the final destination.

- **TT-9133:** Say hello to a powerful addition! Now you can use [request context variables]({{< ref "context-variables#the-available-context-variables-are" >}}) in UDG from a global or data source header. This feature is a game-changer for customizing request data transformations. Imagine converting a form-based POST into a JSON-based PUT with ease.

- **TT-9448:** We've rolled out a user-friendly UI for Request/Response Body Transformation middleware. It's now simpler than ever to manage and optimize how data flows through Tyk.

- **TT-8993:** Adding a new data source is smoother than ever. We've pre-filled the default value for the data source name, saving you time. It's now in the format _fieldName_typeName_, with _typeName_ being _Query_, _Mutation_, _Subscription_, and more.

- **TT-9309:** MDCB now helps you keep a close eye on connected gateways and their health. Stay on top of your network's performance effortlessly.

- **TT-9134:** We've made global headers configuration a breeze for any UDG. These headers will be forwarded to all data sources by default, enhancing your control over data flow.

- **TT-8959:** Introducing a new timeout option, offering you granular control over cache timeout at the endpoint level. Your data, your way.

### Changed

- **TT-9434:** Your feedback matters! We've updated the API creation process in Tyk Dashboard to ensure a seamless experience. Now, after saving, you remain on the same screen, so you can keep configuring without any interruptions.

- **TT-9134:** Header injections configured for any UDG now automatically forward to all data sources. Your configurations are now more efficient and effective.

- **TT-7152:** We've listened to your suggestions and improved usability when configuring and saving UDG data sources. No more unnecessary clicksâ€”simply hit _Save_ and your data source configuration is securely stored.

### Fixed

- **TT-6455:** We've addressed an issue with JWT claim names containing spaces. No more 403 errors when using tokens with such claims; everything works smoothly now.

- **TT-9467:** Good news! The _most popular endpoints_ display is back in action when filtering per API ("enable_aggregate_lookups": true) and the dashboard is utilizing SQL aggregated analytics.

- **TT-9233:** Security is paramount. We've fixed a potential security vulnerability where static and dynamic mTLS requests with expired certificates could be proxied upstream.

- **TT-9275:** The "show analytics for <date>" dropdown option on the Gateway usage chart is now working flawlessly.

- **TT-9365:** Negative values are a thing of the past. The Enforced Timeout configuration no longer accepts negative inputs.

- **TT-8526:** Queries with array parameters are now handled smoothly. UDG no longer drops these parameters from the final request URL sent upstream.

- **TT-9747:** We've resolved an issue in Tyk Dashboard where duplicate API names and listen paths could be created. Your configurations are now as unique as they should be.

- **TT-7550:** Introspecting GraphQL schemas is now better than ever. We've fixed an issue that previously caused errors when dealing with custom root types other than Query, Mutation, or Subscription.
