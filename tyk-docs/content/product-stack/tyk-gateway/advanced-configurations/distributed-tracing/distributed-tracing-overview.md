Distributed tracing is a method of tracking application requests as they flow from frontend devices to backend services and databases. It is used to monitor and troubleshoot requests end-to-end.

Tyk currently supports OpenTracing for distributed tracing. Support for OpenTelemetry is on the near-term roadmap for the Tyk API Gateway. If this is a valuable feature for you, please leave a comment on this [community forum post](https://community.tyk.io/t/faq-opentelemetry-distributed-tracing/5682).
